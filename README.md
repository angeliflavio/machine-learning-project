# Practical Machine Learning Project

This project is part of the *Practical Machine Learning* course by Coursera.

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to 
collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
This project analyses data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The goal is to train machine learning models on the specific data and use them to make 
predictions.
